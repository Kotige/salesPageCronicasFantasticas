## Learnings

This project was made with the intention of creating a webpage using the knowledge of Sass that I recently acquired together with the concepts of flexbox and grid already well established.

One of my main difficulties in the project was the alignment of the items and also organizing the different parts of the code in folders and files so that the code reading and maintenance was easier.

Some study time allowed me to overcome these difficulties and move forward with the project. The page built will soon be an integral part of the Fantastic Chronicles literature and RPG website.
